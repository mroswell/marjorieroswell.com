 I've been an amateur singer-songwriter all of my life. Occasionally I post a few things to YouTube. Though I sometimes show up at community open mics, my usual "gig" is for family occasions: birthdays, seder meals, and bar mitzvahs (including my dad's when he was 83). Someday I'll have time to catalog some of that music! Meanwhile, please enjoy this selection.
