New Jersey LCVâ€™s Environmental Scorecard rates each member of the New Jersey Senate and Assembly on their conservation record and actions taken to protect the environment in the Garden State. The Scorecard holds state legislators accountable for their votes on open space, water and air issues that affect families across our state.

The data is managed by the organization in a Google Spreadsheet, and my app accesses it via the Google Sheet API, and generates a map showing each legislative district, the members, their votes, their scores, and bill details.
