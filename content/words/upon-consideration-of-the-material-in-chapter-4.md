{{< poem >}}
The alpha glycocidic bond is feeling very down,
While the beta glycocidic bond is up, about the town
And bonding glucose as they do, they form disaccharides,
And fiber, glycogen, and more (with some just for the ride).

Don't confuse the beta glucan with the beta glycocidic
(And while you're at it, make a note: the stomach's too acidic
To break the bonds of carbohydratesâ€”cellulose or gums)
That's just the way it is, my friend: you needn't take a Tums.

You'll hydrolyze the alpha 1,4 glycocidic bonds
Just past the valve pyloric, in the small intestine pond.
And once the monosaccharides have crossed into the blood
Be sure the pancreas you've got are not some kind of dud.

    The beta cells make insulin, the alpha cells make glucagon
    They build and break down glycogen to make the system work!
    Glycogenesis! Glycogenolysis!
    Not enough glucose? Try gluconeogenesis!

Some regulate their glucose with an index that's glycemic
At least they try. (Oh my - I think the outcomes are anemic.)
And some think missing protein makes them quite hypoglycemic
And some have diabetes, and they need a daily blood prick.
Well, I'm afraid of needles (of small or wide diameter)
But some must measure sugar with a small hand-held glucometer

In the galaxy of studies for the NET, of this I'm sure:
Glucose, and galactose will never be a bore.
Fructose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, sugars are a-plenty
And now you've read this rhyme so you're among the cognoscenti.

Mono-, di-, oligo-, poly: Plenty here to learn
Just thinking on the subject causes calories to burn....
And while we dream of beta bonds (unable to digest)
It seems the time to end this rhyme and give the brain a rest.
