The choices are stark
All our efforts are noble
But a prize go to Marc--
That's: Mr. Marc Sobel.

I dunno if he's dances
But he's doing the Salsa!
Finding the people:
Tahoma to Tulsa
From Trenton, to Tuscan, Toledo, to Tampa
Finding each teen, each mom, dad, or Grandpa

Some sit on a beach, with strawberry guava
Some will sip tea, while others sip java
No matter cuisine, place (or wig, or toupee)
Here's to our website: dot com, USA

And the Party of Coffee: Our work is ne'er done.
But this poem reprises the fine work of one.
