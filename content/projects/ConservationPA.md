The Pennsylvania Environmental Scorecard rates each member of the State Senate and House on their environmental voting record using the most crucial environmental votes that the Pennsylvania General Assembly took during the current legislative session. The Scorecard holds state legislators accountable for their votes on clean water, air pollution, climate change, and environmental justice, and other environmental issues that affect all Pennsylvanians.

The data is managed by the organization in a Google Spreadsheet, and my app accesses it via the Google Sheet API, and generates a map showing each legislative district, the members, their votes, their scores, and bill details.
