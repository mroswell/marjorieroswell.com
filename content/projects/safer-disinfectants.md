The Environmental Protection Agency created a list of disinfectants (“List N”) that kill the virus that causes COVID‑19. Yet many disinfectants carry an increased health risk, especially to respiratory systems. SaferDisinfectants.org helps users easily find the safer disinfectants from the list. Filter the list for every Surface Type and Use Site.

The website is actually sites: The list itself is a Datasette table. Every day we "scrape" the EPA's list, and incorporate any additions or changes. We read the active ingredients and make a "Safer" or "Increased Risk" designation, accordingly. The rest of the site was created using the Hugo framework.

The site will be of special interest to organizations such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes who hire custodial services.
