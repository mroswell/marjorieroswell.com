## Frequently Asked Questions {#id .className style="margin:auto " class="mb-5"}


{{< faq "What brought you to music?" >}}
Music is a part of my family heritage. My mother was a music major. My aunt on my father’s side studied at Julliard. They are gone, but the music they passed down remains. My family has at least a century-old tradition of writing songs for family occasions. When I have more time I’ll add some more of the family songs to the collection!

{{< faq "Do you have a particular favorite of the family occasion songs?" >}}
I think my favorite line was one that my mother wrote half a century ago, to the tune of Get Me to the Church on Time. “For such a [nachas](https://yiddishwordoftheweek.tumblr.com/post/315848528/naches-%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%AA), Just move your [tuchas](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tuchus), and get Barbara to the [shul](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/shul) on time.

{{< faq "Do you play an instrument?" >}}
I play the guitar, and I plunk on a ukulele or a piano. In a pinch, I can be found playing plastic spoons to accompany a jam session.

{{< faq "Do you have perfect pitch?" >}}
No. But when I listen to a piano, I often know what notes are being played. When I listen to a guitar, I often know what chords are being played.

{{< faq "Freelance developer: that could mean many things. What specifically do you work on?" >}}
I’m a web developer who has always been especially interested in data visualization. I love making interactive maps, and I’ve built a number of “scorecard maps” for advocacy organizations.

{{< faq "What are you working on now?" >}}
I’m currently working on building a website called Safer Or Toxic, to help individuals, schools, hospitals and janitorial companies to sort out which disinfectants are safer for human health. I think it’ll be a cool site, and I'll be able to launch it in July. It’s a project of the Maryland Pesticide Education Network.
